# Kickstarter-analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze a data set and help Louise gain an understanding of the relationship between fudning goals and launch daates of other campaigns.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date was completed using a PivotTable and PivotChart. In order to complete the PivotTable, there wera a few items that needed to be further broken down to provide the necessary information for the analysis. For example, "Category and Subcategory" was a column from the original dataset that was then separated by parent category and subcategory to easily pivot amongsst subcategories. This was done using the "delimited" function within the data tools tab. As well as converting the time to a day/month/year format from the Linux outputs. The PivotTable was created by moving certain aspects into the PivotTable fields as shown in this image below ![PivotTableFields](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102090016/161407966-cbe66e0b-6b5c-4766-88cf-cbdd35dc62ea.png) This easily allowed the ability to create the table and alter the information between the selection of year and parent category. ![Picture2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102090016/161408048-44b9cf98-a573-41f4-8165-0b20e05a4706.png)
However, the "years" filter was broken down into months once it was on the PivotTable. The row dropdown could be selected to further separate the data by years, months, or quarters. Month was selected as it would provide the most useful information for the analysis summary. The line graph below was constructed from this data output by selecting the PivotTable and inserting a line graph. The line graph below was created. This line graph creates a visualization that may be more helpful to quickly gather insights than the PivotTable. ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102090016/161408207-d691deb6-94c9-4d87-8e94-a84d13122971.png)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Difficulties encountered during the Outcomes Based on Launch Dates was trying to get the years to display as months. The instructions were helpful during this step and allowed me to solve where I was having trouble.
