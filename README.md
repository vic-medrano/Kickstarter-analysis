# Kickstarter-analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze a data set and help Louise gain an understanding of the relationship between fudning goals and launch dates of other campaigns. Ultimately, this analysis will help her see how comparable her project was to similar projects whether through funding goal, launch date, outcomes, and subcategory. 
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date was completed using a PivotTable and PivotChart. In order to complete the PivotTable, there wera a few items that needed to be further broken down to provide the necessary information for the analysis. For example, "Category and Subcategory" was a column from the original dataset that was then separated by parent category and subcategory to easily pivot amongst subcategories. This was done using the "delimited" function within the data tools tab. As well as converting the time to a day/month/year format from the Linux outputs. The PivotTable was created by moving certain aspects into the PivotTable fields as shown in this image below ![PivotTableFields](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102090016/161407966-cbe66e0b-6b5c-4766-88cf-cbdd35dc62ea.png) This easily allowed the ability to create the table and alter the information between the selection of year and parent category. ![Picture2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102090016/161408048-44b9cf98-a573-41f4-8165-0b20e05a4706.png)
However, the "years" filter was broken down into months once it was on the PivotTable. The row dropdown could be selected to further separate the data by years, months, or quarters. Month was selected as it would provide the most useful information for the analysis summary. The line graph below was constructed from this data output by selecting the PivotTable and inserting a line graph. The line graph below was created. This line graph creates a visualization that may be more helpful to quickly gather insights than the PivotTable. ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102090016/161408207-d691deb6-94c9-4d87-8e94-a84d13122971.png)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The analysis of outcomes based on goals was created to find the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled play projects. This was done by creating a range of goals to further categorize and analyze the outcome base on the goal for the project. To filter the data and find the count of projects using the goal range, plays, and the outcome of each play, the COUNTIFS function was used to sort this data. For example to find the number of successful plays with a goal of less than $4000, a formula like the following was used in Excel: *=COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!$D:$D, "<1000", Kickstarter!$F:$F, "=successful", Kickstarter!$R:$R, "=plays")*   This was able to tell Excel that data was to be taken from the sheet labeled Kickstarter. Rows and selective criteria were then used to further filter. $D:$D, “<1000” refers to the column D which held all the goals and to count any project with a  goal of less than $1000. The formula can be seen in the image below as well as the information that was obtained from this formula and the formula that will be mentioned shortly. ![CountIfs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102090016/161450056-8f3d4723-98a6-405d-a8ed-01a4f4434fad.png)
This process was used in a similar fashion for rows F to find all successful projects and row R to further filter out only projects that were plays. Once the number of projects for all criteria was found, the process was repeated for varying goal ranges and differing outcomes such as failed and canceled projects. Once this was complete, the number of projects for each box as seen below was divided by the total number of projects to find the percentage of outcomes for each goal range. In this data set the number of successful projects less than $1000 was 141, this was divided by the total number of projects, 186, and that answer was then multiplied by 100 to find the percentage of successful projects for the goal range of less than $1000. Once all the information was found, a line chart(below) was inserted to reflect the data.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Difficulties encountered during the Outcomes Based on Launch Dates was trying to get the years to display as months. The instructions were helpful during this step and allowed me to solve where I was having trouble. A difficulty encountered during the outcomes based on goals data was in using the COUNTIFS function. It took me using the hint to figure out how to use the function to sort a range of data such as creating two criteria ranges to find all projects within a goal range. An additional problem encountered was when the formula looked correct and was still obtaining 0 results even when I knew there were counts that should be populating those cells. This was the result of filtering the subcategory for “play” rather than “plays”. These challenges have been useful to show me how important it is to pay attention to detail, and it makes me more aware of how to catch these mistakes in the future. 
## Results
### Outcomes Based on Launch Date Conclusions
The outcomes based on launch date PivotTable and chart showed that a majority of campaigns launched in May and June became successful. We can also conclude that December launch dates had a relatively equal amount of failed and successful campaigns
### Outcomes Based on Goals Conclusion
The outcomes based on goals sheet shows that there were 0 canceled play campaigns and that the most successful campaigns had goals less than $5000. The data also shows that 100% of campaigns with a goal of between $45000 and $49999 failed, however this can be a misleading statement since there was only one project in that goal range. The data also shows that an equal number of projects succeeded and failed for the goal range of $15000 to $19999. 
### Limitations
A limitation is that this data may not be able to be applied to multiple countries. What is successful in one may not be as successful in another. Which is an appropriate idea for Louise to take into account. Additionally, some projects may have had more resources to market their fundraising and thus explains why some may have been able to collect money so quickly. Both of these limitations are important to take into account when interpreting data.
### Additional Possible Tables/Graphs that could be created
We could create a pie chart for the theater outcomes by launch date data for each month. The three “slices” of the chart would represent the percentage of successful, failed, or canceled campaigns as a fraction of the total campaigns for each month. Additional PivotTables could be created such as one that allows the user to pivot between both outcomes and country of each campaign. Bar charts could be created to represent the number of successful campaigns for each category and or subcategory. A scatterplot could be made to look at the relationship for the average amount donated and the number of backers for each campaign. There are many different tables and graphs to be created and analyzed with the large amount of data and variables that were collected.
